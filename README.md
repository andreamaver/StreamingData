<h1  align="center">Electrical consuption forecasting</h1>
<h2  align="center">Text mining and search project</h2>


The project consists in the application of different techniques to forecast the electrical consumption one mounth ahead to find the best performing one. Three main types of methods were tried, namely ARIMA, UCM and machine learning (a K-nearest neighboor and a recurrent neural network based on LSTM).

The data has been provided by the professor and contains measurements every ten minutes from the first of January to the thirty of November. It is available in the [data](https://github.com/andreamaver/StreamingData/blob/main/data2022_train.csv "data2022_train.csv") file.

You can check out the full paper (available only in Italian) describing all the steps in great detail at: [SDMTS_Andrea_Maver](https://github.com/andreamaver/StreamingData/blob/main/SDMTS_Andrea_Maver.pdf "SDMTS_Andrea_Maver.pdf").


The project was developed mainly in R, but the RNN was implemented using Python. In the [Scripts](https://github.com/andreamaver/StreamingData/tree/main/Scripts) folder all the scripts used for the project can be found.
